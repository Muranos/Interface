- Add an advisory note to the Extra Action Button for users to use Edit Mode instead  
    Taking a frame out of Edit Mode and letting Bartender4 handle it instead  
    is problematic at best, and for the Extra Action Button in particular we  
    don't even do anything to it other then making it movable.  
    Favoring Edit Mode and avoiding issues with the button not working right  
    seems like the best path forward, even though I was not able to  
    reproduce issues in raids or dungeons myself.  
- Give Masque the proper bar name, instead of the old index  
    Fixes #103  
- Only include the Leave Vehicle button on the new Vehicle bars in WoW 10  
- Update Artwork for the Leave Vehicle custom button
