# Twintop's Resource Bar
A multi-class resource bar, based on my (Twintop's) previous Shadow Priest Insanity Bar WeakAura set from Legion.

Currently supported specs:
- Balance Druid
- Elemental Shaman
- Shadow Priest

This is a fully customizable resource bar for multiple classes and specs to use to track their primary resource while in combat. Features include:
- Full color, font, and texture customization of every part of the bar to make it suit your UI or make certain situations stand out.
- Audio and visual cues for when important spells (e.g. Devouring Plague, Earth Shock) can be cast.
- Time To Die of enemies you've targeted
- Spell icons for your current casting spell and many others that are related to your primary resource or for tracking.

Spec specific features included for Shadow Priests:
- Calculates how long you have left until Voidform will end in Hungering Void, given the current Haste and Crit levels
- Tracks Shadowy Apparition spawns (with Auspicious Spirits talented) and incoming Insanity as a result.
- Tracks Shadowfiend/Mindbender swings and expected incoming Insanity from future swings.

Bar text can be configured to show the following data in whatever format you'd like:
- Current resource, mas resource, resource from Hardcasting a spell, resources incoming from Passive Sources (e.g. Auspicious Spirits, Shadowfiend/Mindbender, Death and Madness, and Eternal Call to the Void procs)
- Current Haste%, GCD, Crit%, Mastery%
- Number of Damage over Time spells out on targets
- Time To Die of enemies you've targeted
- Spell icons for your current casting spell and many others that are related to Insanity or tracking.
