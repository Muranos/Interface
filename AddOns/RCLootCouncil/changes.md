## Changes

Updated for patch 10.1.5

### Roll column

Switched to a new system that's much lighter on comms for propergating the automatic random rolls. This should fix the issues some people have with the last few sessions not receiving random rolls.

This change is not backwards compatible, once the ML upgrades, everyone will have to in order to see the random rolls.

## Bugfixes

- *Fixed issues with detecting remaining trade time on clients with russian locale.*
- *Fixed issue preventing the list of council members that has/still has to vote from showing.*
