## [SL-2.6.1](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.6.1) (2021-11-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.6.0...SL-2.6.1) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Highlights of this update

#### Dynamic groups

- Converted some 'Type' categories (Illusions, Mounts, Toys, Titles) in the Main list into dynamically-populated search results of the Main list itself. Please @Runawaynow in Discord with any feedback on this modification as it may need adjustments.
- Dynamic categories (and Pet Journal) are ignored when showing Source tooltips (since they are not actual Sources for Things) and likewise they no longer add to the progress/total of the Main list since they already exist elsewhere in the list.


#### Ad-Hoc Window Updates

- Removed Ad-Hoc updates from being enabled by default. People who don't like the lag will have to turn it on themselves since it causes `/att random` to not work until the Main list is opened.
- Modified `/att random` to work with Ad-Hoc Updates better, and print more info in chat if the Main list has not yet been updated.


### Notable changes:

- Not loaded NPC names will now dispay as 'Retrieving Data' instead of 'nil'.
- Reverted some map tech logic since it often caused Things nested in a single category (i.e. Holiday) to get split into multiple headers in the Zone based on the Type (i.e. Quests > Holiday, Vendor > Holiday, Holiday > Secrets, etc.).
- Achievements/Criteria are properly placed under creature groups as necessary as well.
- Items that are 'saved' (i.e. usually because of a questID they trigger) will still show their cost content in minilists.
- Profiles should work better for those of you who switch between different WoW client locales (this fixes multiple 'Default' profiles).
- Fixed world bosses (and many others) showing their respective Encounter being contained within themselves instead of themselves being the Encounter. (Makes sense right?)
- Synced more Classic dungeons and fixed some that were synced in previous update.
- Moved Heroic Scholomance into the Classic Dungeons and Raids section with its Normal Mode version.
- Tracked and fixed a bug with Scholomance items (that actually fixed nearly 3000 items elsewhere in the addon).
- Added Shadowlands Explorer achievement.
- Added Turkey Soul and marked two Pilgrim's Bounty quests as not repeatable.
- Moved Frog Soul since it can be fished anywhere in Shadowlands apparently.
- Moved Pepe appearance unlocks into 'Secrets' for now since it disappeared when the Toys category became dynamic.
- Selfie camera is back and cleaned up a little bit (also in 'Secrets').
- Cleaned up Pepe appearance unlocks so they show accurately regardless of the user's tracking of Achievements & Quests.
- Fixed Heroic Tusks of Mannoroth.
- Cleaned up lots of duplicated Draenor BoE Greens. They show up from the respective treasures when you see the Zone minilists, but otherwise are not listed multiple times.
- Other fixes.
