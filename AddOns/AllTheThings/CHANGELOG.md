# AllTheThings

## [DF-3.0.8](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/DF-3.0.8) (2022-11-27)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/DF-3.0.7...DF-3.0.8) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Functional changes

- Added a list of acceptable tooltips to which ATT is allowed to 'hook' information. This should fix some bad interaction with other addons that led to some extremely stuttery/laggy siutations. In the future, if we notice situations where tooltips do not receive ATT data, they will need to be manually added to the hookable list.


### Data fixes

- Additions for Alliance Dracthyr questline.
- Fixes to some quests that were made more accessible with pre-patch.
- Some Pigrim's Bounty adjustments.
- Updated Feralas.
- More preparation for Dragonflight release content and removal of Shadowlands content.
- Other fixes.
