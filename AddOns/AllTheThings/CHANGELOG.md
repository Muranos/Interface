### Functional changes

- We weill grey out Things your current character cannot acquire i.e. when using Account mode.
- Don't show an NPC's face for Difficulty headers.
- Displayed text for a Difficulty header will now include the relative Instance name in situations where the Difficulty header becomes 'removed' from its Instance (i.e. popout of difficulty, showing difficulty in tooltip, etc.).


### Logic fixes

- Fixed Achievement popouts not showing their required Criteria Sources.
- Fixed non-Instance-related Difficulty headers showing '[Unknown]'.
- Fixed an issue where tooltips for 'saved' content could ignore rendering any fillable content.
- Fixed a Lua bug when having no guild and attempting to see a Guild group tooltip.
