### Highlights of this update

#### Winter Veil (fixes) ðŸŽ„

This is mainly a hotfix release to repair "You're a Mean One..." quest and "Stolen Present" rewards for Horde characters.

- Fixed some Winter Veil quests that were broken for Horde (and maybe some for Alliance) in the last update, including "You're a Mean One...", "New Year Celebrations!" and "Winter's Presents".
- Adjusted description for Winter Veil tailoring patterns.
- Removed wrong yearly mark from many Winter Veil quests.

Merry Christmas, everyone! ðŸŽ…

### Notable changes:

- Fixed more missing Horde/Alliance quests (same as with "You're a Mean One...", this only affects quests that are identical for both factions but have different `questID`s).
- BFA Arathi/Darkshore Rares for Horde sould be marked as complete more reliably now.
- Fixed Brawler's Claws showing as available from the heirloom category.
- "Incense of Infinity" will now show what conduits you are missing.
- Other fixes.
